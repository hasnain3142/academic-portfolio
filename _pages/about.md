Hi, I'm Hasnain.

I graduated from NEDUET Karachi, PK with Bachelors in Computer and Information Systems Engineering.

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer where I am involved in areas like Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models.

I am interested in various topics related to AI/ML which includes:
<ol>
<li> Computer Vision </li>
<li> Natural Language Processing </li>
</ol>

Beyond my professional experience, I am working on an independent research project on large language models exploring their challenges. Furthermore, I actively volunteer as a trainer on ICodeGuru for teaching underprivileged students in Pakistan in the local language, Urdu.

I am currently seeking a PhD program in the US to advance my research and contribute to the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal learning.
